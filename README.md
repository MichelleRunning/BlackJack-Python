# Python Blackjack Game 🎴

A simple text-based Blackjack game written in Python as part of my 100 Days of Python learning journey.

The project includes:
- Player hit or stand choice
- Dealer logic (hits until reaching 17 or more)
- Ace handling (counts as 11 or 1 automatically)
- Score comparison and win/loss detection

This project helped me practice:
- Loops
- Conditionals
- Functions
- Basic game logic
- Working in PyCharm and using GitHub
